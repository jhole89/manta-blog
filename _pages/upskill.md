The software industry has changed greatly since it's early days. Where once we had only a handful of
languages that focused on desktop applications; there now exists over 200 turing complete languages, with
the cloud and web being the predominant deployment target. In the last 20 years we've seen the rise of 
containers, the behemoth that is Kubernetes, databases as a services, Continuous Integration becoming the 
norm, and servers that can be spun up in a matter of seconds.

Much of this has done wonders to free and empower engineers to develop at faster speeds than every,
but no longer is it good enough to only know a single language and deployment model. Now engineers and
architects are expected to know everything from infrastructure provisioning on the cloud, through to 
backend development, container orchestration, deployment models, CI/CD, and front end development. This
is without even considering which languages are being used, and their associated design patterns. 

More so than ever engineers, architects and CTO's will find themselves asking questions such as; 
should we be following object-oriented or functional programming design patterns? What about serverless 
vs self-managed? Or even before which cloud vendor do we use? Ok we've decided on AWS, but do we use 
EMR or Glue for data processing? How about runtime environments for our containers - we could use ECS,
Fargate, or EKS?

With all of these options is no wonder that many companies struggle to migrate to the cloud - it's not 
a simple step, and many issues arise from the sudden leap in skills required. This is where we can help. 
We're able to not only show you what best practice looks like in the modern software stack, but upskill 
you and your team in these techniques, and how they can best ways to adopt these practices into your 
business workflows today.
