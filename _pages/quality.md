title: Quality Assurance

As software and software engineering continues to become a predominant driver of business value,
fast development and quick delivery to market has become increasingly important. However, we are
all human and often fast development involves corners being cut, tests being skipped, and software
best practices being put on the back burner; that's ok, priorities are important, but it doesn't 
mean those issues should always persist.

Developers are not the only one's that care about maintainable code and architecture. Whilst users
never see the code behind the application, how an application is designed and written directly
affects how long it takes to ship new features. Features that take weeks might only take a few days 
if the codebase was easy to change.

Maintainable applications lead to increased delivery and reliability - a considerable factor in the 
user experience, and the user experience is the only thing that matters in software.

However, when your team is focused and targeted on generating new revenue, sometimes you just don't 
have the time or resource to identify and approach these issues. That's where we come in. 

Through our extensive experience we've seen the good and the bad, and are able to offer object views 
and recommendations that will not only remediate these problems, but elevate your applications and 
platforms to the next level; increasing maintainability, flexibility, sustainability, and delivery
timelines.

Quality is not a question of why but when - so why not today?
