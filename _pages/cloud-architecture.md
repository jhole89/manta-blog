title: Cloud Architecture

Infrastructure as code (IaC) gives us the benefits of creating and maintaining the same 
architecture time and time again, and avoiding issues of misconfiguration or undocumented manual processes. Due to 
the explosion of cloud services, we feel that Terraform provides the best solution for this, as it additionally allows us 
to avoid vendor lock in that other solutions such as CloudFormation do not afford.
