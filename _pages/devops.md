Automated DevOps solutions following best practice to ensure bugs never touch live systems; using docker and kubernetes

DevOps a discipline that should be used to empower developers and automate away feedback loops in order to test, deploy, 
orchestrate, and maintain their applications in safe isolated containers. We look for tools that follow this premise 
with support from the ground up for docker and kubernetes, rather than trying to rework legacy tools. Due to this we 
believe in tooling such as Circle CI, FluxCD, Spinnaker, GitLab, and of course GitHub.
