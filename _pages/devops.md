DevOps is a set of practices and workflow disciplines that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops).
It aims to shorten the development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality.

Here at Manta Innovations we believe that DevOps is so much more than just continuous delivery. We believe in DevOps
as a way to empower developers and automate away feedback loops; freeing developers to develop, test, deploy, 
orchestrate, monitor, and maintain their applications in safe isolated containers.

Our automated DevOps solutions follow best practise to ensure bugs never touch live systems and that there is only one
definitive source of truth - your code. We seek to reduce the time between application development and deploying to 
production systems to minutes not months, and we believe in using industry leading tools that follow this premise. 

Our solutions use the best tools for the job, ones that support containers from the ground up, rather than trying to 
rework legacy tools (you won't find Jenkins anywhere in our stack). Due to this we believe in tooling such as 
Circle CI, FluxCD, Spinnaker, GitLab, and of course GitHub.

Don't let your applications and delivery suffer - engage with us on how we can help you automate away painful
manual process and kickstart your DevOps journey.
