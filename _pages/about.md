Hi I'm Joel, the owner of Manta Innovations Ltd.

Having worked within both large and small organisations specializing in Big Data, Machine Learning, and Cloud 
Architecture, I took the opportunity in 2018 to start up Manta Innovations Ltd. I am now building it out as a software 
consultancy and looking for friendly clients with interesting problems that we can assist with solving.

Here at Manta Innovations we strongly believe in choosing the correct languages and tools to solve the problem at hand. 
There are a number of core languages that we look to utilise, which based on our experience and expertise, we have 
identified as best tools for the various services we offer.
