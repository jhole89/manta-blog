Welcome, this is the beginning of my series on AWS’s recent Online Summit 2020; where I write about my 
thoughts and learnings from the range of topics presented. 

The content here describes my own thoughts and understandings from 
the material presented, not the views of the presenters, who I do not speak for.

### My thoughts on the AWS Summit Online 2020

Recently I attended, via video conference, the AWS Summit 2020 (US & Canada). This was AWS’s first online only summit, 
and I wanted to share my write up and thoughts from the talks/videos I attended.

Given that all the talks were actually pre-recorded videos, I could have watched each one over several days after the event. 
However, I still wanted to emulate the feeling of a conference, and let's be honest, there's only so much time in the day.

So instead I chose the talks that I would have attended had it been in person, and ones that lined up on the virtual agenda. 
With all of these talks I want to emphasise that these are my own views and how I interpreted/understood the content presented to me, 
rather than the views of the speakers.

### Will 2020 see organisations move the cloud? 

Amazon’s CTO, Werner Vogels, thinks so;

> "If nothing else, these past few months have truly ushered in an era in technology where we are seeing fundamental shifts 
in how everyone is feeling, not only in technology itself but how to access that technology, as well as how we build 
that technology” - Werner Vogels, Amazon CTO

Werner Vogels opened the conference by talking about the unprecedented increase in demand for AWS due to the sudden shift 
to WFH practices, as individuals and organizations alike lean on the cloud to support them.

He predicted that in 2020 and beyond, we would see most organisations moving to a completely cloud based environment 
as it would allow their workers to access any application, service, or data, from anywhere in the world. 

This is a sentiment I share, and something I'm not surprised to hear from the author of [All Things Distributed](https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/).
