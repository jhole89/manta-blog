Welcome, this is part of my ongoing series on AWSâ€™s recent Online Summit 2020, 
where I write about my thoughts and learnings from the range of topics presented. 
As always, the content here describes my own thoughts and understandings from the material presented, 
not the views of the presenters, who I do not speak for.
